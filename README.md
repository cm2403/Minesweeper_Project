# Welcome to Minesweeper!

Hello! My name is Cian and welcome to my version of Minesweeper!

I have a passion for coding and have been doing so since 2019 but have never done anything extra curricular to my education like this

I plan to use this project to broaden my knowledge and expertise about software engineering and development by trying to add as many aspects of full stack development as possible during the free time that I have. As I add more and more features I will continue to detail them in either the 'Releases' section of the GitHub as well as this document

I have the game currently deployed using Vercel [here](https://minesweeper-project-ca5513.vercel.app/), so please feel free to try it out and give any feedback!

_Thanks and happy mining!_
